/**
* This exercise has you implement a synchronize() method that will
* copy all records from the sourceDb into the targetDb() then start
* polling for changes. Places where you need to add code have been
* mostly marked and the goal is to get the runTest() to complete
* successfully.
*
*
* Requirements:
*
* Try to solve the following pieces for a production system. Note,
* doing one well is better than doing all poorly. If you are unable to
*  complete certain requirements, please comment your approach to the
* solution. Comments on the "why" you chose to implement the code the
* way you did is highly preferred.
*
* 1. syncAllNoLimit(): Make sure what is in the source database is
*    in our target database for all data in one sync. Think of a naive
*    solution.
* 2. syncAllSafely(): Make sure what is in the source database is in
*    our target database for all data in batches during multiple
*    syncs. Think of a pagination solution.
* 3. syncNewChanges(): Make sure updates in the source database is in
*    our target database without syncing all data for all time. Think
*    of a delta changes solution.
* 4. synchronize(): Create polling for the sync. A cadence where we
*    check the source database for updates to sync.
*
* Feel free to use any libraries that you are comfortable with and
* change the parameters and returns to solve for the requirements.
*
*
* You will need to reference the following API documentation:
*
* Required: https://www.npmjs.com/package/nedb
* Required: https://github.com/bajankristof/nedb-promises
* Recommended: https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15
* Recommended: https://www.npmjs.com/package/await-the#api-reference
